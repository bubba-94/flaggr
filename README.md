# flaggr

> [!NOTES]
> UNDER PROGRESS

Flaggr is just a fun C application where i can print out pre defined flags by running the program with a script and a parameter passed to a certain function/flag/counrty.

## About

This project will help develop my understanding for bits and how they are localized.
Also implementation of different tools, linters, scripts and what not to try and "create" a smaller bigger project.  
I will try and develop several flags as bitmaps and print them out in pretty colors.  

## Installation

INCOMING

## Usage

Study it, use it, examine it, decline it or do whatever.  
I am doing this because i want to expand my knowledge and eventually create something more real.

## Testing

INCOMING (if needed)
